## General Info
BHS-FTC is a fork of the existing FTC-APP code. There is a sample Tele-Op and Autonomous Program to give an idea of what the code will look like. All code used for the robot will be placed in **TeamCode/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode**
 
Our phones will be running Android 10. You can build the app on the following platforms:
* Windows
* Mac
* Linux

If you have any questions testing locally, shoot me an email: JordanT2021@365.bcsd.org or thomas.noble.jordan@gmail.com
